    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
        This easy blueberry cobbler is about to become one of your absolute favorite easy dessert recipes! 
        I'm a huge blueberry fan and this blueberry dessert does not disappoint! 
        It's so ooey gooey, moist, sweet, and oh so delicious! After it bakes, you get a slightly crispy edge (which is my favorite part!)

            <li>In a medium bowl, stir together the flour with 1 cup of the sugar. Add in the milk and then pour in the melted butter and vanilla extract. Stir until combined. </li>

            <li>Bake on the middle oven rack uncovered for 45 minutes - hour, until the top is a light golden brown and a toothpick comes out clean. </li>
